/**
 * A GameTimer is an object that sends a GameTimerAction to a Game or a
 * Player at regular intervals.  It can be used, for example, in games
 * where players have deadlines for performing certain actions (e.g., chess
 * clock, 24-second clock in a basketball simultation).<P>
 * 
 * Each LocalGame, HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer has a GameTimer created
 * for it when the object is created. If one of these entities needs to have
 * a "tick" at regular intervals, the will typically execute code such as:
 * <PRE>
 *   // set timer to go off every 100 milliseconds
 *   getTimer().setInterval(100);
 *   getTimer().start();
 * </PRE>
 * then its 'timerTicked()' method will be invoked every 100 milliseconds;
 * it can then perform whatever time-related operations it wishes to perform.
 * <P>
 * If additional timers are required, they must be explicitly created, and
 * then handled as a TimerAction (in the checkAndHandleAction method) or
 * TimerInfo (in the receiveInfo method).
