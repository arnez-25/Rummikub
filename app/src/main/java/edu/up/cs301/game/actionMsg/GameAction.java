/**
 * An action for a generic game.  A game action is something that a player
 * tells the game that it wants to do (e.g., put an 'X' on the top-left
 * tic-tac-toe square).  The game will then decide whether the player is
 * allowed to perform that action before effecting the action on the
 * players behalf.  Most real games will subclass GameAction to define
 * actions that are relevant to the particular game.  A GameAction contains
 * the player as part of its state; this way the game always knows what
 * player sent it the action.
 * <P>
 * Several "generic" of GameAction classes are already defined.  These
 * include MyNameIsAction and GameOverAckAction.
